# GAN Image Denoising  
### Enhancing Image Generation with Denoising GANs

## Overview

This project focuses on improving the visual quality of images generated by deep learning models by combining **image generation** and **image denoising** into a single workflow. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are effective at producing realistic images, their outputs often contain noise and visual artifacts. This project addresses that limitation by applying a dedicated convolutional denoising model to enhance GAN-generated images.

The approach is demonstrated using the **Fashion MNIST dataset**, which provides a simple and controlled environment for experimenting with image generation and restoration techniques.

## Problem Statement

GAN-generated images frequently suffer from noise, especially during early or unstable training phases. This noise reduces image clarity and limits the usefulness of generated outputs.

The goal of this project is to:
- Generate realistic images using a GAN
- Reduce noise using a CNN-based denoising model
- Show how combining generation and restoration improves image quality

## Methodology

The system consists of three main components:

- **Generator**  
  Learns to generate synthetic images from random latent vectors.

- **Discriminator**  
  Learns to distinguish between real images from the dataset and fake images produced by the generator.

- **Denoising Model**  
  A convolutional encoder–decoder network trained to remove Gaussian noise from images and reconstruct cleaner versions.

The GAN (generator and discriminator) is trained adversarially on the Fashion MNIST dataset. Separately, the denoising model is trained using images corrupted with artificially added Gaussian noise. After training, images generated by the GAN are passed through the denoising model to improve visual quality.

## Dataset

- **Fashion MNIST**
  - 60,000 training images
  - 10,000 test images
  - 28×28 grayscale images
  - 10 clothing categories

Images are normalized for stable training, and Gaussian noise is added when training the denoising model to simulate real-world image degradation.

## Results

As training progresses, the GAN learns to generate increasingly realistic fashion images. Applying the denoising model significantly reduces noise and improves sharpness and contrast in the generated images.

The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through visual comparisons between noisy outputs and their denoised counterparts.

By separating generation and restoration into specialized models, the system produces cleaner and more visually appealing outputs while remaining simple and interpretable.
